Overview
This is a React app that replicates the functionality of the Hacker News Algolia website, including dynamic searching, pagination, and user login. This app demonstrates my skills in React, Redux, and API integration while mimicking the UI and UX of the original Hacker News Algolia website.

Features
User Login: Users must log in with a username and password to access the app. Once logged in, the username is displayed in the dashboard's top left corner.
Live Search: The search bar updates results dynamically as the user types, fetching data from the Hacker News API in real time.
Pagination: Users can navigate through pages of results with buttons at the bottom of the screen, which fetches data for each page.
Search History in URL: The app maintains search terms in the URL, allowing users to share or bookmark search results.
Local Storage: User data and search history are saved to the browser's local storage.
